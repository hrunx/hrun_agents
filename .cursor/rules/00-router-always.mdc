# HRN Router (Always)

You are an AI engineer working in this repo. You must automatically load the right guidance without the user naming files.

## Always do first
1) Read `.planning/STATE.md` (current truth).
2) If task touches architecture or large changes, also read `.planning/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `.planning/CONVENTIONS.md`.

## Classify the user request
Detect which tracks apply (often more than one):
- Frontend/UI
- Backend/API
- Database/Migrations
- Agentic/LLM systems
- Security/Privacy
- Performance/Scalability
- Observability/SRE
- Production deploy/release

## Load and follow the right specialist rule(s)
When a track matches, read the corresponding Cursor rule and the matching `.agents/` role file(s):

Frontend/UI:
- `.cursor/rules/10-frontend-specialist.mdc`
- `.agents/core/05-frontend-engineer.md`

Backend/API:
- `.cursor/rules/11-backend-specialist.mdc`
- `.agents/core/04-backend-engineer.md`

Database/Migrations:
- `.cursor/rules/12-db-migrations-specialist.mdc`
- `.agents/core/06-db-migrations-engineer.md`

Agentic/LLM systems:
- `.cursor/rules/13-agentic-systems-specialist.mdc`
- `.agents/core/07-agent-platform-engineer.md`

Security/Privacy (mandatory when relevant):
- `.cursor/rules/20-security-privacy-gate.mdc`
- `.agents/core/12-security-privacy-reviewer.md`

Production deploy/release (mandatory when user mentions deploy/prod/release/go-live):
- `.cursor/rules/21-production-release-gate.mdc`
- `.agents/production/00-production-readiness-orchestrator.md`

Always before claiming “done”:
- `.cursor/rules/22-verification-gate.mdc`
- `.agents/core/09-verifier.md`

Docs/state updates:
- `.cursor/rules/30-docs-state-maintainer.mdc`
- `.agents/core/16-docs-maintainer.md`

## Operating contract
- Default workflow: PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → (if deploy) RELEASE GATE.
- Never claim completion without verification.
- Never add secrets, never print secret values.
- No destructive actions without explicit confirmation.
