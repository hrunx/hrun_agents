# Baseline Engineering Rules (Universal)

## Plan first
- For any non-trivial task, write a plan with atomic steps and verification.

## Small diffs
- Prefer minimal edits; avoid refactors unless requested.

## Safety
- No destructive commands without explicit confirmation.
- No deploy/push unless user explicitly requests.
- Never log or commit secrets or PII.

## Truthfulness
- Do not guess stack details. Use repo files as truth. If unknown, write TODO.

## Output protocol
When proposing work, include:
1) Acceptance truths
2) Plan
3) File edits (diffs)
4) Tests
5) Verification steps
6) Status: ✅ Ready for review | ⚠️ Blocked
