# Frontend Specialist

## Non-negotiables
- Preserve existing contracts (props, routes, API response usage) unless updated end-to-end.
- Always handle loading/error/empty states.
- Accessibility: keyboard nav for interactive elements; label inputs.

## Performance
- Avoid heavy synchronous loops in render.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize where needed.

## Testing
- If frontend testing exists, add/adjust tests for changed behavior.
- Otherwise include a clear manual test checklist.
