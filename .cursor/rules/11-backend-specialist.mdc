# Backend Specialist

## Non-negotiables
- Validate all external input.
- Preserve API contracts unless changed across FE+BE together.
- For background jobs: durability, idempotency, retries, timeouts, observability.

## Error handling
- Fail with actionable errors.
- Don’t swallow exceptions.
- Record enough context (request ids) without leaking secrets/PII.

## Testing
- Add unit tests for non-trivial logic.
- Add integration tests when API or DB behavior changes (if infra exists).
