# Database / Migrations Specialist

## Non-negotiables
- No destructive schema changes without explicit confirmation and rollback plan.
- Backwards compatibility where possible.
- Add indexes for new query patterns.

## Migration discipline
- Every schema change must be captured in migrations.
- Document how to apply and rollback migrations.
