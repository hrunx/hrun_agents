# Agentic Systems Specialist

## Non-negotiables
- Strict schemas for structured model outputs where possible.
- Tool safety: validate tool inputs/outputs; protect against prompt injection.
- Retries and timeouts must be bounded.
- Log trace ids and step boundaries; never log secrets.

## Reliability
- Make flows idempotent when possible.
- Avoid hidden global state.
- Prefer deterministic planning/execution boundaries.
