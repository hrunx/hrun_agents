# Security & Privacy Gate (Mandatory)

Before merging, check:
- AuthN and AuthZ: correct enforcement at the boundary.
- Input validation: injection-safe, SSRF-safe, file upload constraints.
- Secrets: never logged or committed.
- PII: no leaks to logs/analytics; retention minimized.
- Dependencies: no obvious vulnerable or malicious additions.
- Least privilege: server-only keys never used client-side.
