Use this as your Cursor “User Rules” (global). Keep it short.

- Always follow repo rules in `AGENTS.md` and `AI_RULES.md` if present.
- Always read `.planning/STATE.md` first.
- Default workflow: PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → RELEASE GATE.
- Never claim done unless verification passes.
- Never touch secrets; only list env var names needed.
- No destructive commands or prod deploy without explicit confirmation.
- Keep diffs minimal; avoid refactors unless requested.
