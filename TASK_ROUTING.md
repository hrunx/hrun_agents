# Task Routing Cheatsheet (You never need file names)

Just speak normally in Cursor. The Router rule auto-selects:

- “UI”, “frontend”, “React”, “styling”, “component” → Frontend Engineer
- “API”, “Netlify function”, “server”, “backend”, “Supabase”, “DB write” → Backend Engineer
- “migration”, “schema”, “SQL”, “RLS” → DB Migrations Engineer
- “agents”, “LLM”, “tools”, “pipeline”, “stages” → Agent Platform Engineer
- “security”, “auth”, “PII”, “secrets”, “RLS” → Security & Privacy Reviewer
- “deploy”, “production”, “release”, “go live” → Production Readiness Orchestrator

Tip: For big tasks, use parallel chats:
Plan → Check → Execute → Verify → Release
